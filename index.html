            <p>Like everyone else privileged enough to be deemed ‘nonessential,’ I was stuck inside once the
                pandemic began, tracking its relentless spread through my news feed.</p>
            <p>But in my inbox, I noticed another
                narrative unfolding in parallel with the news. Day by day, my promotional emails grew stranger and more
                frantic. They were full of new phrases: </p>

                out.”
                “As

            <p>But this felt different. The emails’ tone swung wildly, some somber and authoritative, others
                uncomfortably chipper. They reminded me of George Saunders’ “jon,” a short story about a group of
                teenage
                influencers, raised in captivity in a marketing facility, who struggle to express their overwhelming
                emotions
                through the constrained language of advertising.</p>

            <p>Writer Kelly Pendergrast proposes a <a href="https://reallifemag.com/ill-at-ease/">new spatial
                    metaphor</a> for the gig economy: not a platform, with its connotations of a level field, but a
                membrane:</p>

            <p>“The membrane flips the platform sideways, putting the customer on one side and everything else on the
                other,
                hidden behind a shimmering screen.”</p>

            <p>The membrane, Pendergrast writes, obscures the ‘sacrifice zone’ — “the out-of-sight arena where our goods
                are
                produced and services are procured, conveniently hidden behind the scrim of frictionless technology.”
                Now,
                the
                membrane is thinning, and the sacrifice zone is harder to wish away. Under the strain of describing
                hazard
                pay,
                relief funds, and strikes, corporate language is imploding in my inbox.</p>
